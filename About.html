            Strucaid is the First and Only Nigerian Start-up that helps you complete your building projects without the stress. 
           <br><br>We know building a home can be fulfilling but it is also very demanding and stressful, especially when you have to shop for materials and transport them to the construction site.
            <br><br>That is why we decided to make things easier for you by bringing the shops to your smartphone.
           <br><br>With just a swipe and a click, you can order your building materials and have them delivered to your doorstep (or wherever you want them) in no time.
